## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/performance-tuning-sql-server.git
cd performance-tuning-sql-server
```

### 2. Setup SQL Server Environment

Ensure you have a SQL Server instance running and accessible. You will need administrative access to execute some of the tuning scripts.

### 3. Analyze Performance

Use the `analyze_performance.sql` script to gather initial performance metrics and identify potential issues.

```sql
-- analyze_performance.sql
-- This script gathers initial performance metrics and identifies potential issues

-- Capture query execution statistics
SELECT
    qs.sql_handle,
    qs.execution_count,
    qs.total_worker_time AS total_cpu,
    qs.total_elapsed_time AS total_duration,
    qs.total_logical_reads AS total_reads,
    qs.total_physical_reads AS total_physical_reads,
    qs.total_logical_writes AS total_writes,
    SUBSTRING(st.text, (qs.statement_start_offset/2) + 1,
    ((CASE statement_end_offset
        WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(st.text)
        ELSE qs.statement_end_offset END
        - qs.statement_start_offset)/2) + 1) AS statement_text
FROM
    sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
    CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) st
ORDER BY
    qs.total_worker_time DESC;
```

### 4. Create Indexes

Use the `create_indexes.sql` script to implement indexing strategies that can improve query performance.

```sql
-- create_indexes.sql
-- This script creates indexes to improve query performance

-- Example: Creating an index on a frequently queried column
CREATE INDEX idx_example_column
ON your_table_name (example_column);
```

### 5. Optimize Queries

Use the `query_optimization.sql` script to rewrite and optimize queries for better performance.

```sql
-- query_optimization.sql
-- This script contains optimized queries

-- Example: Optimized query
SELECT
    column1,
    column2
FROM
    your_table_name
WHERE
    column1 = 'some_value'
    AND column2 = 'some_other_value';
```

### 6. Analyze Execution Plans

Use the `execution_plan_analysis.sql` script to analyze query execution plans and identify any inefficiencies.

```sql
-- execution_plan_analysis.sql
-- This script analyzes execution plans

-- Example: Displaying the execution plan for a query
SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON;
GO
-- Your query here
SELECT
    column1,
    column2
FROM
    your_table_name
WHERE
    column1 = 'some_value'
    AND column2 = 'some_other_value';
GO
SET SHOWPLAN_XML OFF;
GO
```

### 7. Measure Performance Before and After Tuning

Use the `performance_metrics.sql` script to capture performance metrics before and after tuning.

```sql
-- performance_metrics.sql
-- This script captures performance metrics

-- Example: Capture CPU and I/O statistics
SELECT
    sql_process_id,
    sql_process_name,
    total_cpu_usage_ms,
    total_io_usage_mb
FROM
    sys.dm_exec_requests;
```

### 8. Generate Reports

Document the performance metrics before and after tuning in the `reports` directory.

#### `reports/performance_before_tuning.md`

```markdown
# Performance Metrics Before Tuning

## Query Execution Statistics

| Query | Execution Count | Total CPU Time | Total Duration | Total Reads | Total Physical Reads | Total Writes |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| ...   | ...             | ...            | ...            | ...         | ...                  | ...          |
